### Import/Export Google Chrome's custom search engines

**_Quit Google Chrome before exporting/importing custom search engines._**

To Export from one machine:
```
./export.sh
```

To Import on a different machine:
```
./import.sh
```

Note:
- The import script will drop all existent entries before inserting saved entries.
- This can be used to wipe search engines which are automatically added by many web sites.
